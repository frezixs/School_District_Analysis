Given school information and students information, calculate and analysis these data from many different aspect 
for example, from passing rate, per student budget. We can also divide the students into grade group, if we don't have 
an existing category, we may create one by ourselves. The discoverage can help schools make teaching dicisions and 
influence the budget as well.
